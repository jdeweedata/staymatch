# Testing Limits (CRITICAL - enforced across all implementers)
testing_policy:
  description: "Strict limits on test writing to prevent over-engineering"
  rules:
    - "Each task group: Write ONLY 2-8 focused tests maximum"
    - "Testing-engineer: Write maximum 10 additional strategic tests"
    - "Total tests per spec: Target 45-62 tests (not 100+)"
    - "Run ONLY tests related to current task group, NOT entire suite"
    - "Focus on critical paths, not edge cases during initial implementation"
  enforcement: "All implementers must follow these limits. Verification will check test counts."

# Code Reuse Policy (CRITICAL - enforced across all implementers)
reuse_policy:
  description: "Aggressive code reuse to maximize efficiency"
  rules:
    - "Check spec Section 7 'Reusable Components' before writing new code"
    - "Extend existing code rather than duplicating logic"
    - "Document reuse opportunities in implementation reports"
    - "New components must justify why existing code cannot be extended"
  enforcement: "Verification will flag unnecessary new code"
