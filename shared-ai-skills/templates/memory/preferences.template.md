# User Preferences

Learned preferences for this project and user.

---

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer explicit types over inference for function parameters
- Use early returns for guard clauses
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

## Commit Conventions

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Include scope when relevant: `feat(admin): add user management`
- Keep subject line under 72 characters

## Workflow

- Always run type checks before committing
- Test changes locally before pushing
- Push to staging first for testing
- Use PR workflow for production changes

## Communication

- Be concise, skip unnecessary explanations
- Show code diffs for changes when helpful
- Summarize actions at end of complex tasks
- Use tables for structured information

## File Organization

- Never create files in project root (except configs)
- Documentation goes in `docs/` subdirectories
- Skills go in `.claude/skills/`
- Follow existing naming conventions
